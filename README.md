# Restaurant Ratings Geospatial Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of restaurant ratings with a focus on geospatial patterns. The primary objective is to explore the relationship between location and ratings by leveraging geospatial analysis techniques. The project involves mapping the data, analyzing correlations, and visualizing trends across different countries and cities.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading**: Restaurant rating data is preprocessed and loaded for analysis.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Leveraged GeoPandas and Shapely libraries to perform mapping and analyze spatial distributions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified the correlation between geographic location and restaurant ratings.
- **Country-Wise Ratings**: Examined and visualized average ratings for each country.
- **City-Wise Ratings**: Explored city-specific trends using advanced plotting techniques.

## Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **GeoPandas**: For geospatial data processing and mapping.
- **Shapely**: To manipulate and analyze geometric objects.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating insightful 
visualizations.
- **Pandas**:For data manipulation and loading.

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualized the geographic distribution of restaurant ratings to identify regional patterns.
2. **Correlation Findings**: Highlighted significant correlations between geographic factors and ratings.
3. **Country-Level Analysis**: Analyzed average ratings for restaurants grouped by country, revealing notable differences across regions.
4. **City-Level Insights**: Plotted and examined trends specific to cities.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:
- Geospatial maps showcasing the distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Bar plots and heatmaps for country-wise and city-wise average ratings.
- Correlation plots to depict the relationship between location attributes and ratings.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights into how location impacts restaurant ratings. By utilizing geospatial tools and detailed visualization techniques, the project sheds light on regional and urban trends in the dining industry.<br>
There is no significant correlation between a restaurant's location (longitude and latitude) and its rating. The restaurant's geographic position does not appear to influence its aggregate rating based on this dataset.

## Future Scope
- Extend the analysis to include other factors like cuisine type, pricing, or customer reviews.
- Incorporate machine learning techniques to predict ratings based on geospatial and other features.
- Explore temporal trends by adding a time dimension to the analysis.
